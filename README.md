# Phishing Detection Tool 

**📌 Project Overview**

Phishing attacks are one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats today.
Attackers create fake websites that look legitimate to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details, and personal data.

This project is a Real-World Phishing URL Detection System that combines:

🔐 Rule-Based Security Logic

🤖 Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)

🌐 URL Structure Analysis

🧠 Brand Impersonation Detection

Unlike basic ML-only projects, this system follows an industry-inspired hybrid approach (Rules + ML) similar to real SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows.

**🎯 Project Objective**

The main goal of this project is to:

Analyze a user-provided URL

Verify its authenticity using multiple security checks

Classify it as:

✅ Legitimate

🚨 Phishing

⚠️ Suspicious

The system avoids blind prediction and performs proper validation before making a final decision.

🧠 Brand Impersonation Detection
